# **Rotten Tomatoes Movie Rating Prediction**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to classify movies based on their ratings using a machine-learning model trained on Rotten Tomatoes data. The dataset includes various features related to critic and audience ratings, which are used to predict the rating category of a movie.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of movie-related features such as:
- **Tomatometer Ratings**: Aggregated critic scores.
- **Audience Ratings**: Viewersâ€™ ratings.
- **Critic & Audience Counts**: The number of reviews considered.
- **Runtime & Certification**: Movie duration and age restrictions.

## **Model & Performance Metrics**
A **Random Classifier model** was trained, and its performance was evaluated using multiple metrics:

### **Model Evaluation Metrics**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 0.0082
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 0.0903
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 0.0082
- **R-squared Score**: 0.9856
- **Accuracy Score**: 99.18%
